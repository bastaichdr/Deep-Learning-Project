Data Type: Text
- The data used is movie reviews from the website rotten tomatoes. The data can be found at 
  - https://www.kaggle.com/c/movie-review-sentiment-analysis-kernels-only/data?select=train.tsv.zip
    
Problem Type: Binary Classification
- The outcome is whether the review is possitive or negative. So the review will be predicted to be one of these two by the model.
  
Proposed Network Architecture: Feed-forward NN, Recurent NN, and Convolution NN
- Multiple architectures will be tested in attempt to find which performs the best while remaining the most efficient.
